# Introduction
This is my implementation of a Soundboard app created as a UWP application. This is for my 3rd year Mobile Application Development 2 module in GMIT. Lecturer of the module is Damien Costello.

# Requirements:
- Well-designed UI that is fit for purpose and provides a good user experience.
- Uses local/roaming storage for storing data and/or settings that are necessary for or
enhance this user experience.
- Demonstrates appropriate use of the sensors/hardware available on UWP capable devices
o Accelerometer, gyroscope, location services, sound, network service (connect to
server for data), camera, multi touch gestures
- The app must be more than a simple information app. It must have interactivity as part of
the design.

# UWP FamilyGuy SoundBoard
For my project, I have decided to make a soundboard. The soundboard will consist of sounds from various characters from the Tv Series Family Guy. The user can navigate between characters and choose a sound to play. The user can simply click/tap on an image to play a sound.
