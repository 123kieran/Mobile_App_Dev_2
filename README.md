# Introduction
This is my implementation of a Soundboard app created as a UWP application. This is for my 3rd year Mobile Application Development 2 module in GMIT. Lecturer of the module is Damien Costello.

# Requirements:
- Well-designed UI that is fit for purpose and provides a good user experience.
- Uses local/roaming storage for storing data and/or settings that are necessary for or
enhance this user experience.
- Demonstrates appropriate use of the sensors/hardware available on UWP capable devices
o Accelerometer, gyroscope, location services, sound, network service (connect to
server for data), camera, multi touch gestures
- The app must be more than a simple information app. It must have interactivity as part of
the design.

# Submission Requirement:
Your App must be submitted for certification on the Windows Store.

# UWP FamilyGuy SoundBoard
For my project, I have decided to make a soundboard. The soundboard will consist of sounds from various characters from the Tv Series Family Guy. The user can navigate between characters and choose a sound to play. The user can simply click/tap on an image to play a sound. 

# System Requirements
- Windows 10 Operating System
- Windows 10 Mobile
- Integrated Mouse
- Integrated Touch

# Running the app
//I ran the windows App cert test on the App and it passed, See Image "WindowsTest.png". Waiting for certification from store.
