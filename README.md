# Introduction
This is my implementation of a Soundboard app created as a UWP application. This is for my 3rd year Mobile Application Development 2 module in GMIT. Lecturer of the module is Damien Costello.

# UWP (Universal Windows Platform) Soundboard
For my project, I have decided to make a soundboard. The soundboard will consist of sounds from various characters from the Tv Series Family Guy. The user can navigate between characters and choose a sound to play. The user can simply click/tap on an image to play a sound.
